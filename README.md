### Dumbarton Oaks' Katsura

One of the oldest katsura trees (_Cercidiphyllum japonicum_) in North America lives in the gardens of Dumbarton Oaks. Today you can see the sprawling octopus-like katsura behind the R Street Façade, right by the entrance gate, lunging toward the East Lawn with its long-limbed branches that swoop down, out, and then upwards. Beatrix Farrand, the garden landscape architect who designed the gardens, noted in her Plant Book for Dumbarton Oaks that the katsura was growing exactly where it stands today on the East Lawn when Robert and Mildred Bliss bought the property.[^ref1]

And how exactly did it get there? This essay is an attempt to answer that question and paint of portrait of the katsura’s story. One tree’s story opens a world of possibility. For one, old trees are contemporaneous with historic events, allowing us to tell their story and how the world around them has changed and stayed the same. But trees are more than just narrative devices: we name places after trees and our cultural practices are influenced by our interaction with them. Despite plant blindness associated with a society distant from them, they are nonetheless central to our lives. For example, historian Eric Rutkow’s book American Canopy: Trees, Forests, and the Making of a Nation illustrates the importance of trees in the United States from the colonial period to today. The biography below looks at disparate moments of time in which katsura appears—million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, poetic images a millennium after the common era, two hundred years ago during the United Sates’ horticultural boom, and Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura today.

### The Japanese Judas Tree 

Katsura belongs to the genus _Cercidiphyllum_ and is one of two species that belong to it, the other being _Cercidiphyllum magnificum_. The genus, _Cercidiphyllum_, refers to the fact that these two species of trees have heart-shaped leaves similar to the Judas tree (_Cercis siliquastrum_). Samuel B. Parsons’ nursery in Flushing was probably the first commercial nursery to sell katsuras in the United States, and one of the nursery’s descriptive catalogs compares the katsura’s trees to a Judas tree.[^ref2] When _Cercidiphyllum japonicum_ sheds its leaves in the fall, its yellow and orange leaves decompose and release the chemical maltol into the air leaving a sweet smell. Farrand accounted for the katsura’s deciduous quality in her design of the East Lawn, adding plants that brought out its beauty and provided “additional evergreen screen” when the tree had no leaves.[^ref3] You can find flowers on the katsura in the springtime, though they do not have much ornamental value since they do not have petals. Katsura is a dioecious tree, meaning that individual trees have male or female flowers. The male flowers are purple-red while the female flowers are yellow-green. Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura is a male—one slight sway in the tree’s branches and pollen flies all over. 

Its species name _japonicum_ refers to how katsura is native to Japan, though it is also locally existing to China. Katsura occurs in mountainous regions of Japan, and the tree’s light and soft wood is used in cabinetry and the interior finish of buildings. In Southern China, Cercidiphyllum japonicum grows in mixed mesophytic forests of Southern China, disturbed and secondary mixed forests, and along bodies of water in the mountains. 

### A Living Fossil

_Cercidiphyllum_ is an ancient genus. Fossil plants resembling _Cercidiphyllum_ leaves appeared in the mid-Cretaceous. It was widespread in the Northern Hemisphere during the Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic periods.[^ref4] For the most part, _Cercidiphyllum_ has remained largely unchanged—we might even call it a living fossil. Charles Darwin coined the term "living fossils" to refer to species that have survived for millions of years with little morphological change. Aside from changing very little over long periods of time, they also have distribution ranges that are more restricted than in the geologic past. This is to say that these plants can be found in the geological records across many places, though today they are generally locally existing to a smaller range.[^ref5] During the later Cenozoic period, _Cercidyphullum_ experienced regional extinction and its range is now restricted to East Asia.[^ref6] Today, the plant is grown widely across the regions in which it was originally extinct as an ornamental, returning to where it once grew millions of years ago.

### Poetic Traditions

Katsura carries a strong association with the moon in Japanese poetry. The ‘katsura of moon’ is a poetic image with Chinese roots used well before the Heian period. Katsura is associated with the harvest moon when you can most clearly see its shadow in the moon’s center.[^ref7] The oldest extant _Man'yōshū_, a collection of Classical Japanese Poetry compiled sometime after 759, is the _Katsura-bon_ whose name comes from being in the possession of the imperial Hachijō-no-miya family. Prince Hachijō-no-miya Toshihito built the Katsura Imperial Villa, an estate known for evoking the literary tradition of the katsura of the moon with its architectural features.

### Western Desire for Japanese Flora

A craze for trees and flowering plants from East Asia began in the mid-17th century, increased in the 18th and 19th centuries, and plateaued in the early 20th century. The desire for Eastern Asian flora was because of imperial botany (“bring the world’s vegetation home for the delectation of the overseers of empire”).[] Wealthy east coast Americans, too, sought out East Asian flora in the nineteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century, the United States experienced an interest in trees and shrubs. Edward Magruder Linthicum, who owned Dumbarton Oaks between 1846 and 1869, too followed this horticultural interest amid the American horticultural boom of the mid-nineteenth century.  

By the 1840s, Japanese flora reached the United States from Europe thanks to Philipp Franz von Siebold who introduced some plants to Europe in 1829. Japanese was isolationist at this time. Once Matthew Perry negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa on March 31, 1854 after threatening military force against Japan, diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States were established. Japan then opened itself to the world. It showcased its flora, including the katsura in world fairs during the late nineteenth century.
