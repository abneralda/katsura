### Dumbarton Oaks' Katsura

One of the oldest katsura trees (<span eid="Q526549">_Cercidiphyllum japonicum_)</span> in North America lives in the gardens of <span eid="Q1264942">Dumbarton Oaks</span>. Today you can see the sprawling octopus-like katsura behind the R Street Façade, right by the entrance gate, lunging toward the East Lawn with its long-limbed branches that swoop down, out, and then upwards. <span eid="Q437714">Beatrix Farrand</span>, the garden landscape architect who designed the gardens, noted in her _Plant Book for Dumbarton Oaks_ that the katsura was growing exactly where it stands today on the East Lawn when Robert and Mildred Bliss bought the property.[^ref1]

And how exactly did it get there? This essay is an attempt to answer that question and paint a portrait of the katsura as a species throughout time. This biography looks at disparate moments of time in which katsura appears—million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, poetic images a millennium after the common era, two hundred years ago during the United Sates’ horticultural boom, and Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura today.

### The Japanese Judas Tree 

Katsura belongs to the genus <span eid="Q858028">_Cercidiphyllum_</span> and is one of two species that belong to it, the other being _Cercidiphyllum magnificum_. The genus refers to the fact that these two species of trees have heart-shaped leaves similar to the Judas tree (<span eid="Q29488">_Cercis siliquastrum_</span>). Samuel B. Parsons’ Kissena Nursery in Flushing was probably the first commercial nursery to sell katsuras in the United States, and one of the nursery’s descriptive catalogs compares the katsura’s trees to a Judas tree.[^ref2] Its species name _japonicum_ refers to how katsura is native to Japan, though it is also locally existing to China. Katsura occurs in mountainous regions of Japan, and the tree’s light and soft wood is used in cabinetry and the interior finish of buildings. In Southern China, _Cercidiphyllum japonicum_ grows in moist <spain eid="Q3079086">mixed forests of Southern China, disturbed and secondary mixed forests, and along bodies of water in the mountains.[^ref3]

When _Cercidiphyllum japonicum_ sheds its leaves in the fall, its yellow and orange leaves decompose and release the chemical maltol into the air leaving a sweet smell. Farrand accounted for the katsura’s deciduous quality in her design of Dumbarton Oaks' East Lawn, adding plants that brought out its beauty and provided an “additional evergreen screen” when the tree had no leaves.[^ref4] You can find flowers on the katsura in the springtime, though they do not have much ornamental value since they do not have petals. Katsura is a dioecious tree, meaning that individual trees produce either male or female flowers. The male flowers are purple-red while the female flowers are yellow-green. Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura is a male—one slight sway in the tree’s branches and pollen flies all over.

### Prehistoric Ancestors (~80MYA)

_Cercidiphyllum_ is an ancient genus. Fossil plants resembling _Cercidiphyllum_ leaves appeared in the mid-<span eid="Q44626">Cretaceous</span> period. It was widespread in the Northern Hemisphere during the Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic periods.[^ref5] For the most part, _Cercidiphyllum_ has remained largely unchanged. Charles Darwin coined the term "<span eid="Q187419">living fossil</span>" to refer to species that have survived for millions of years with little morphological change. Aside from changing very little over long periods of time, they also have distribution <span eid="Q4257161">ranges</span> that are more restricted than in the geologic past. This is to say that these plants can be found in the geological records across many places, though today they are generally locally existing to a smaller range.[^ref6] During the later Cenozoic period, _Cercidyphullum_ experienced regional extinction and its range is now restricted to East Asia.[^ref7] Even though katsura does not fit the definition of a living fossil, as it has evolved, thinking of the tree and its lineage prompts us to consider how landscapes change over time and why. Take for example how katsura is grown widely asn an ornamental across the regions in which it was originally extinct, returning to where its prehistoric ancestors once grew millions of years ago because of its ornamental beauty.

### Poetic Traditions Inspire Imperial Villa (17C)

The awe-inspiring and ornamental qualities of trees have inspired artistic pursuits throughout time. Take for example how oaks heavily inspired Beatrix Farrand’s design of Dumbarton Oaks’ Green Garden terrace. Katsura, and its literary depictions, inspired the architectural design of the Katsura Imperial Villa. In Japanese poetry, the ‘katsura of the moon’ is a poetic image with Chinese roots used well before the <span eid="Q193292">Heian</span> period. It is associated with the harvest moon when you can most clearly see the shadow of a katsura in the moon’s center.[^ref8] The oldest extant _Man'yōshū_, a collection of Classical Japanese Poetry compiled sometime after 759, is the _Katsura-bon_ whose name comes from being in the possession of the imperial Hachijō-no-miya family. <span eid="Q850601">Prince Hachijō-no-miya Toshihito</span> financed the <span eid="Q1736808">Katsura Imperial Villa</span> and designed architectural features that evoke the katsura’s rich poetic association with the moon. The Palace has four teahouses that represent the four seasons. Geppa-Rō (the moon-on-the-waves-tower), the teahouse associated with autumn, takes its name from a poem by the Tang-dynasty Chinese poet Jai Buyi (772-846) who greatly influenced early Japanese literature.[^ref9]

### Western Desire for Japanese Flora (19C)

A craze for trees and flowering plants from East Asia began in the mid-17th century, increased in the 18th and 19th centuries, and plateaued in the early 20th century. The desire for Eastern Asian flora was because of imperial botany, the "quest to bring the world’s vegetation home for the delectation of the overseers of empire”.[^ref9] Wealthy east coast Americans, too, sought out East Asian flora in the nineteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century, the United States experienced an interest in trees and shrubs.[^ref10] Edward Magruder Linthicum, who owned Dumbarton Oaks between 1846 and 1869, too followed this horticultural interest amid the American horticultural boom of the mid-nineteenth century.  

In Japanese mythology and folklore, katsura links the heavens and the Earth. One myth tells the story of the moon god Tsukuyomi's descent upon Earth and his visit to the goddess of food, Ukemochi. She prepares dinner for him by spitting out boiled rice, seafood, and game. Tsukuyomi, out of of disgust, murders the goddess. Ukemochi's dead body then becomes the Earth's food; her limbs generate foodstuffs such as rice, red beans, and soya grains, and it is through her death human life becomes possible. The _Yamashiro no kuni fudoki_ (‘Annals of Yamashiro Province’), an eigth-century compilation of traditions in Yamashiro province, tells a similiar version of the tale, but specifies that Tsukuyomi manifested as a katsura tree when he met Ukemochi. The katsura's sweet bark smell, often described as cinnamon, attracted Tsukuyomi to the tree. The compiled annals add that Katsura Village, now a neighborhood in modern-day Kyoto, is home to the tree where the moon god descended upon the Earth.[^ref10]

### Western Desire for Japanese Flora (19C)

Dumbarton Oak’s katsura may as well be connected to a heightened trade of Asian flora. A European craze for trees and flowering plants from East Asia began in the mid-17th century, increased in the 18th and 19th centuries, and plateaued in the early 20th century. The desire for Eastern Asian flora was because of imperial botany, the "quest to bring the world’s vegetation home for the delectation of the overseers of empire.”[^ref11] 18th century European trade with Eastern Asia took place in subtropical ports, like South China’s Pearl River Delta and Dejima in Nagasaki, Japan. While the great interest in Chinese and Japanese plants was high, Europe’s temperate climate could not support the sub-tropical plants available. After the initial opium wars, Europeans were able to reach the northern and interior mountainous areas of China. The plants from these areas were better suited for the European climate. By the middle to late 19th century, an uptick of botanical explorations in China took place. A similar phenomenon occurred in Japan. German physician and botanist Philipp Franz von Siebold was posted to <span eid="Q640267">Dejima</span>, the Dutch trading post located in Nagasaki, as resident physician and scientist in 1823.[^ref12] He quickly amassed a botanical collection and later introduced Japanese plants to Europe in 1829, and by the 1840s Japanese flora reached the United States via European trade.[^ref13] [This needs a sentence here to introduce the rest]. Japan also had an <span eid="Q309310">isolationist</span> foreign policy at the time. Once Matthew Perry negotiated the <span eid="Q771451">Treaty of Kanagawa</span> on March 31, 1854, after threatening military force against Japan, diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States were established. Japan then opened itself to the world. It showcased its flora, including the katsura in world fairs during the late nineteenth century. [An example of this].

### Edward Linthicum and Dumbarton Oaks' Garden (1860s)

Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura was thought to have been planted under Linthicum. The idea came from the fact that he established the property’s gardens and had a business relationship with a local nursery. He hired J.H. Small, a renowned English gardener, in 1848 to design Dumbarton Oaks’ gardens with the labor of <span eid="Q12773225">enslaved</span> individuals.[^ref14] Linthicum also owned a hardware store, at what is today Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, where he sold trees and plants via a catalog from Joshua Peirce’s Linnaean Hill Nursery in Rock Creek Park.[^ref15] Peirce sold fruit and ornamental trees grown by persons he enslaved—in fact, he named William Beckett an invaluable part of his business in a petition for compensated emancipation under the <span eid="Q5283407">District of Columbia Emancipation Act</span>.[^ref16] A glance at the introduction of katsuras into the United States, however, undermines the assumption that the Dumbarton Oaks katsura was planted during Linthicum’s ownership.

### Thomas Hogg Jr. Introduces Katsura to the United States (1860s-1870s)

### Thomas Hogg Jr. Introduces Katsura to the United States (1860s-1870s)

<span eid="Q21515943">Thomas Hogg Jr.</span>, whose father established one of New York City’s first nurseries, takes credit for introducing katsura. In an 1879 letter to _The Gardener’s Monthly and Horticulturalist_, Hogg Jr. denied botanist <span eid="Q1066128">Charles Sprague Sargent’s</span> claim that agricultural scientist <span eid="Q901202">William S. Clark</span> introduced katsura to the United States.[^ref17] President Abraham Lincoln appointed Hogg Jr. to the Japanese Consulate in Kanagawa in 1862. Hogg Jr. during his post, which he occupied until 1869, sent his brother James Hogg seeds of Japanese flora. He grew the plants his brother sent him in a private garden.[^ref18] In reference to Sargent visiting James’ garden after Thomas returned from his post in Japan, Hogg Jr. remarked that “it seems incredible that so remarkable a plant could have escaped the notice of so enthusiastic an admirer of trees.”[^ref19] 
<param ve-iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/gardenersmonthly21meeh/page/53">

Although Linthicum and Peirce are contemporaries of the Hogg brothers, Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura probably was not planted during the 1860s. Hogg Jr. introduced katsura to North America in either 1864 or 1865, and his brother James closed their family <span eid="Q155511">nursery</span> in 1867.[^ref20] James would not have been able to sell katsura at a commercial scale since knowledge of propagating and growing Japanese plants was scarce at the time. It was, for this reason, Hogg Jr. sent Samuel B. Parsons, another <span eid="Q1058775">Flushing</span> nurseryman, katsura seeds during his second trip to Japan in the 1870s since he had experience with propagating and growing Japanese plants.[^ref21] Parsons began to sell katsura in 1874 at one foot tall.[^ref22] Linthicum and Peirce also died in 1869, leaving a four or five-year span in which the two could have acquired the tree from the Hogg brothers. The Blount family, who introduced boxwood into the garden, bought the property in 1891 are the most likely candidates for having planted the katsura.
<param ve-iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/gardenersmonthly181876phil/page/256/">

A 1922 <span eid="Q112127197">topographical survey</span> of Dumbarton Oaks gives the diameter of trees across the property, and an unnamed tree (simply referred to as “Tree”) is marked where the katsura should be.[^ref23] Trees are usually measured at a standard height, typically four-and-a-half feet, though this measurement might be a basal diameter since Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura branches quite low. It has a diameter of twenty inches, which would make it at least twenty to thirty years old if it grew happy and healthy.[^ref24] Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura is at least 120 years old—though, the age provided here is only a guess. Dating a tree with only a diameter is difficult without knowing the exact conditions in which the tree grew. Perhaps of interest is John Saul’s Washington Nursery, one of the District’s well-known nurserymen during his time, had started to sell katsura in 1895 and notes the tree being a “recent introduction.”[^ref25]

### Kurato Master Gardener (2023)  

In an effort to extend the lifespan of the katsura, Dumbarton Oaks invited Kurato Fujimoto, a Japanese master gardener, to use indigenous Japanese <span eid="Q48803">horticultural</span> practices on the tree. The technique primarily places _hoozue_, which literally translates to ‘chin cane,’ at the ends of branches to support growth at the extremities. _Hoozue_ essentially acts as a support that encourages branch growth—in turn, new leaves grow and create additional energy for the tree. Fujimoto has two guiding principles for placing a hoozue at the end of a branch: if it needs support or seems to be able to support additional leaf <span eid="Q2945560">biomass</span>. Once those branches are identified, the ground beneath them is marked with a stake or flag and afterwards the distance between them is measured. Then pole fabrication begins.  
<param ve-image
       label="Halfway point of hoozue installation."
       url="https://github.com/abneralda/katsura/blob/main/installation.JPG?raw=true">

_Hoozue_ tends to be single poles with a cross piece at the top, resembling a <span eid="Q193387">croquet</span> mallet. Heavier branches, though, require two poles and a cross piece. Some _hoozue_ elgible branches are above another branch—in that case, a bridge made up of two poles with a long cross piece is installed instead of removing or penetrating the lower branch. The hoozue at Dumbarton Oaks is made out of the hard and durable <span eid="Q157417">_robinia pseudoacacia_</span> (black locust), though the poles are usually made out of <span eid="Q1330391">_thujopsis dolabrata_</span> (hiba arborvitae) in Japan. Ron Henderson, landscape architect and a collaborator of Fujimoto,  comments on the positive effect of hoozue: “We [Americans] have a bit of a naturalistic tendencies or wilderness tendencies or, you know, we don't coppice and hedge and show human alteration of plants quite as much as other cultures and this gives a different kind of evidence of care that many in North America are not used to seeing. And I think as a consequence, it's helped. It's helped some people see that we are, in fact, taking care of these living things.”[^ref26]

### Conclusion 

### Conclusion 

Old trees, much like Dumbarton Oaks' katsura, are contemporaneous with historic events. And by telling their story we see how the around them has changed and stayed the same. But trees are more than just narrative devices: we name places after trees and our culture is influenced by our interaction with them. Despite <span eid="Q60772055">plant blindness</span> associated with a society distant from them, they are nonetheless central to our lives. If we calibrate our attention to the temporal and spatial scales of trees, we get a complicated history of a tree across different times and places. It also complicates the notion of a historic garden, in particular, the one at Dumbarton Oaks. It is a historic garden designed by Beatrix Farrand—historic in the sense that yes, Farrand designed a beautiful garden, but also historic in the sense that the land in which she laid out her vision had a particular history that superseded her. The landscape was not a _tabula rasa_, an empty land upon which Farrand then engraved her design. The katsura is a case in point in how landscapes are constantly changing, and the various organisms that live on them change. But perhaps more interesting is the power of trees: we move them across seas for their beauty-and unknowingly plant them where their ancestors once sat before, a reunion across time and space.
