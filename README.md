### Dumbarton Oaks' Katsura

One of the oldest katsura trees (_Cercidiphyllum japonicum_) in North America lives in the gardens of Dumbarton Oaks. Today you can see the sprawling octopus-like katsura behind the R Street Façade, right by the entrance gate, lunging toward the East Lawn with its long-limbed branches that swoop down, out, and then upwards. Beatrix Farrand, the garden landscape architect who designed the gardens, noted in her Plant Book for Dumbarton Oaks that the katsura was growing exactly where it stands today on the East Lawn when Robert and Mildred Bliss bought the property.[^ref1]

And how exactly did it get there? This essay is an attempt to answer that question and paint of portrait of the katsura’s story. One tree’s story opens a world of possibility. For one, old trees are contemporaneous with historic events, allowing us to tell their story and how the world around them has changed and stayed the same. But trees are more than just narrative devices: we name places after trees and our cultural practices are influenced by our interaction with them. Despite plant blindness associated with a society distant from them, they are nonetheless central to our lives. For example, historian Eric Rutkow’s book American Canopy: Trees, Forests, and the Making of a Nation illustrates the importance of trees in the United States from the colonial period to today. The biography below looks at disparate moments of time in which katsura appears—million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, poetic images a millennium after the common era, two hundred years ago during the United Sates’ horticultural boom, and Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura today.

### The Japanese Judas Tree 

Katsura belongs to the genus _Cercidiphyllum_ and is one of two species that belong to it, the other being _Cercidiphyllum magnificum_. The genus, _Cercidiphyllum_, refers to the fact that these two species of trees have heart-shaped leaves similar to the Judas tree (_Cercis siliquastrum_). Samuel B. Parsons’ nursery in Flushing was probably the first commercial nursery to sell katsuras in the United States, and one of the nursery’s descriptive catalogs compares the katsura’s trees to a Judas tree.[^ref2] When _Cercidiphyllum japonicum_ sheds its leaves in the fall, its yellow and orange leaves decompose and release the chemical maltol into the air leaving a sweet smell. Farrand accounted for the katsura’s deciduous quality in her design of the East Lawn, adding plants that brought out its beauty and provided “additional evergreen screen” when the tree had no leaves.[^ref3] You can find flowers on the katsura in the springtime, though they do not have much ornamental value since they do not have petals. Katsura is a dioecious tree, meaning that individual trees have male or female flowers. The male flowers are purple-red while the female flowers are yellow-green. Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura is a male—one slight sway in the tree’s branches and pollen flies all over. 

Its species name _japonicum_ refers to how katsura is native to Japan, though it is also locally existing to China. Katsura occurs in mountainous regions of Japan, and the tree’s light and soft wood is used in cabinetry and the interior finish of buildings. In Southern China, Cercidiphyllum japonicum grows in mixed mesophytic forests of Southern China, disturbed and secondary mixed forests, and along bodies of water in the mountains. 

### A Living Fossil

_Cercidiphyllum_ is an ancient genus. Fossil plants resembling _Cercidiphyllum_ leaves appeared in the mid-Cretaceous. It was widespread in the Northern Hemisphere during the Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic periods.[^ref4] For the most part, _Cercidiphyllum_ has remained largely unchanged—we might even call it a living fossil. Charles Darwin coined the term "living fossils" to refer to species that have survived for millions of years with little morphological change. Aside from changing very little over long periods of time, they also have distribution ranges that are more restricted than in the geologic past. This is to say that these plants can be found in the geological records across many places, though today they are generally locally existing to a smaller range.[^ref5] During the later Cenozoic period, _Cercidyphullum_ experienced regional extinction and its range is now restricted to East Asia.[^ref6] Today, the plant is grown widely across the regions in which it was originally extinct as an ornamental, returning to where it once grew millions of years ago.

### Poetic Traditions

Katsura carries a strong association with the moon in Japanese poetry. The ‘katsura of moon’ is a poetic image with Chinese roots used well before the Heian period. Katsura is associated with the harvest moon when you can most clearly see its shadow in the moon’s center.[^ref7] The oldest extant _Man'yōshū_, a collection of Classical Japanese Poetry compiled sometime after 759, is the _Katsura-bon_ whose name comes from being in the possession of the imperial Hachijō-no-miya family. Prince Hachijō-no-miya Toshihito built the Katsura Imperial Villa, an estate known for evoking the literary tradition of the katsura of the moon with its architectural features.

### Western Desire for Japanese Flora

A craze for trees and flowering plants from East Asia began in the mid-17th century, increased in the 18th and 19th centuries, and plateaued in the early 20th century. The desire for Eastern Asian flora was because of imperial botany, the "quest to bring the world’s vegetation home for the delectation of the overseers of empire”.[^ref8] Wealthy east coast Americans, too, sought out East Asian flora in the nineteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century, the United States experienced an interest in trees and shrubs.[^ref9] Edward Magruder Linthicum, who owned Dumbarton Oaks between 1846 and 1869, too followed this horticultural interest amid the American horticultural boom of the mid-nineteenth century.  

By the 1840s, Japanese flora reached the United States from Europe thanks to Philipp Franz von Siebold who introduced some plants to Europe in 1829.[^ref10] Japan at the time had an isolationist foreign policy. Once Matthew Perry negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa on March 31, 1854 after threatening military force against Japan, diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States were established. Japan then opened itself to the world. It showcased its flora, including the katsura in world fairs during the late nineteenth century.

### Edward Linthicum and Dumbarton Oaks' Garden

Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura was thought to have been planted under Linthicum. The idea came from the fact that he established the property’s gardens and had a business relationship with a local nursery. He hired J.H. Small, a renowned English gardener, in 1848 to design Dumbarton Oaks’ gardens with the labor of enslaved individuals.[^ref11] Linthicum also owned a hardware store, at what is today Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, where he sold trees and plants via a catalog from Joshua Peirce’s Linnaean Hill Nursery in Rock Creek Park.[^ref12] Peirce sold fruit and ornamental trees grown by persons he enslaved—in fact, he named William Beckett an invaluable part of his business in a petition for compensated emancipation under the District of Columbia Emancipation Act. A glance at the introduction of katsuras into the United States, however, undermines the assumption that the Dumbarton Oaks katsura was planted during Linthicum’s ownership.[^ref13]

### Thomas Hogg Jr. Introduces Katsura to the United States

Thomas Hogg Jr., whose father established one of New York City’s first nurseries, takes credit for introducing katsura. In an 1879 letter to _The Gardener’s Monthly and Horticulturalist_, Hogg Jr. denied botanist Charles Sprague Sargent’s claim that agricultural scientist William S. Clark introduced katsura to the United States. President Abraham Lincoln appointed Hogg Jr. to the Japanese Consulate in Kanagawa in 1862. Hogg Jr. during his post, which he occupied until 1869, sent his brother James Hogg seeds of Japanese flora. He grew the plants his brother sent him in a private garden. In reference to Sargent visiting James’ garden after Thomas returned from his post in Japan, Hogg Jr. remarked that “it seems incredible that so remarkable a plant could have escaped the notice of so enthusiastic an admirer of trees.”[^ref14] 

Although Linthicum and Peirce are contemporaries of the Hogg brothers, I hypothesize that Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura was not planted during the 1860s. Hogg Jr. introduced katsura to North America in either 1864 or 1865, and his brother James closed the nursery in 1867.[^ref15] My guess is that James would not have been able to sell katsura at a commercial scale since knowledge of propagating and growing Japanese plants was scarce at the time. In fact, this article notes how “… probably because it was some years after its introduction before our nurserymen discovered how to propagate it rapidly by green cuttings, and seeds were difficult to obtain.”[^ref16] It was, for this reason, Hogg Jr. sent Samuel B. Parsons, another Flushing nurseryman, katsura seeds during his second trip to Japan in the 1870s since he had experience with propagating and growing Japanese plants.[^ref17] Parsons began to sell katsura in 1874 at one foot tall.[^ref18] Linthicum and Peirce also died in 1869, leaving a four or five-year span in which the two could have acquired the tree from the Hogg brothers. The Blount family, who introduced boxwood into the garden, bought the property in 1891 are the most likely candidates for having planted the katsura. I was unable to find the papers of Linthicum and Peirce, nor able to examine the Samuel B. Parsons Papers. Documents like personal correspondence and ledger books, from the Linthicum or Blount era, would confirm or deny the hypothesis presented here. 

A 1922 topographical survey of Dumbarton Oaks gives the diameter of trees across the property, and an unnamed tree (simply referred to as “Tree”) is marked where the katsura should be.[^ref] Trees are usually measured at a standard height, typically four-and-a-half feet, though this measurement might be a basal diameter since Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura branches quite low. It has a diameter of twenty inches, which would make it at least twenty to thirty years old if it grew happy and healthy.[^ref] Dumbarton Oaks’ katsura is at least 120 years old—though, the age provided here is only a guess. Dating a tree with only a diameter is difficult without knowing the exact conditions in which the tree grew. Perhaps of interest is John Saul’s Washington Nursery, one of the District’s well-known nurserymen during his time, had started to sell katsura in 1895 and notes the tree being a “recent introduction.”[^ref]
